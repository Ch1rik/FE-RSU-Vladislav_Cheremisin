       <h4>Early life</h4>
       <p>
           Sergei Yesenin was born in Konstantinovo in Ryazan Governorate of the Russian Empire to a peasant family. <br>
He spent most of his childhood with his grandparents, who essentially raised him. <br>
He began to write poetry at the age of nine. <br>
In 1912, Yesenin moved to Moscow, where he supported himself working as a proofreader in a printing company. <br>
The following year he enrolled in Moscow Charnyavsky University as an external student and studied there for a year and a half. <br>
His early poetry was inspired by Russian folklore. <br>
In 1915, he moved to Petrograd, where he became acquainted with fellow-poets Alexander Blok, Sergey Gorodetsky, Nikolai Klyuev and Andrei Bely and became well known in literary circles. <br>
Blok was especially helpful in promoting Yesenin's early career as a poet. <br>
Yesenin said that Bely gave him the meaning of form while Blok and Klyuev taught him lyricism. <br>

       <h4>Life and career</h4>
       <p>
           
In 1916, Yesenin published his first book of poems, Radunitsa. <br>
Through his collections of poignant poetry about love and the simple life, he became one of the most popular poets of the day. <br>
His first marriage was in 1913 to Anna Izryadnova, a co-worker from the publishing house, with whom he had a son, Yuri. <br>
From 1916 to 1917, Yesenin was drafted into military duty, but soon after the October Revolution of 1917, Russia exited World War I. <br>
Believing that the revolution would bring a better life, Yesenin briefly supported it, but soon became disillusioned. <br>
He sometimes criticised the Bolshevik rule in such poems as The Stern October Has Deceived Me. <br>
In August 1917 Yesenin married for a second time to Zinaida Raikh. <br> 
They had two children, a daughter Tatyana and a son Konstantin. <br>
The parents quarreled and lived separately for some time prior to their divorce in 1921. <br>
Tatyana became a notable writer, and Konstantin Yesenin would become a well-known soccer statistician. <br>
In September 1918, Yesenin founded his own publishing house called the "Labor Company of the Artists of the Word". <br>
Together with Anatoly Marienhof, they founded the Russian literary movement of imaginism. <br>
In the fall of 1921, while visiting the studio of painter Georgi Yakulov, Yesenin met the Paris-based American dancer Isadora Duncan, a woman 18 years his senior. <br>
She knew only a dozen words in Russian, and he spoke no foreign languages. <br>
They married on 2 May 1922. <br>
Yesenin accompanied his celebrity wife on a tour of Europe and the United States. <br>
His marriage to Duncan was brief and in May 1923, he returned to Moscow. <br>
In 1923 Yesenin became romantically involved with the actress Augusta Miklashevskaya to whom he dedicated several poems. <br>
The same year he had a son by the poet Nadezhda Volpin. <br>
Their son, Alexander Esenin-Volpin grew up to become a poet and a prominent activist in the Soviet dissident movement of the 1960s. <br>
Since 1972 till his death in 2016, he lived in the United States, a famous mathematician and teacher. <br>
In 1925 Yesenin met and married his fourth wife, Sophia Andreyevna Tolstaya (1900-1957), a granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy. <br>
As Yesenin's popularity grew, rumors began to circulate about his heavy drinking and alcohol-fueled public outbursts. <br>
Fellow poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, wrote that after his return from America Yesenin became more visible in newspaper police log sections than in poetry.

       <h4>Death</h4>
       <p>On 28 December 1925 Yesenin was found dead in his room in the Hotel Angleterre in St Petersburg.</p>
